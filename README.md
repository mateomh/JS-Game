When you fire up the game, you are welcomed by a walking rexy loading screen. After the loading finishes you will see the main title screen.

In this screen you will have to enter your name so the game can start. If no name is entered the game will not start.

Then you will go into the game itself, where Rexy will start running on a long platform. To jump you can either use the up arrow on your keyboard or a mouse click.

To make it a little more fair to Rexy the game has the double jump functionality, so he can get to those further platforms that randomly show up. The double jump can be activated when Rexy is already in the air by hitting the jump action button again.

Through the game you will find this delicious cherries that Rexy can eat. If you eat one of those you will get an extra 200 points added to your score, so try to eat as many as you can.

After Rexy falls into the abyss, you are taken to the game over scene, where you can see your score and some buttons.

The buttons give the options: 
- To start over the game with the same player name.
- Go to the title screen where you can enter a new player name.
- See the score board with the top 5 scores in the game.

You can check if you made it and if you are at the top of the board.
