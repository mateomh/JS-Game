## Elements of the game

### Background

The background should be a reminiscence of a forest, it should have trees or plants and it may contain a body of water. The image should not be very strong so it does not take the attention from the foreground.

### Main character

The main character is a dinosaur, it is better if it can stand on two legs, like a T-rex 🦖, so it's easier to see him running.

### Platforms

The platforms should follow the forest theme set with the background. they should be in different sizes, minimum of three sizes, so the game is more challenging for the player.

### Items

The items that the character is going to find in the world should be food items, like a cherry 🍒, burger 🍔 , or cheese 🧀, don't limit the items to just things a dinosaur would it, make it fun and add some crazy food items.

There should be at least 3 types of buttons:
- **Back**: This is for the player to go back and play again. It can also be a replay button.
- **Home**: This is for taking the player to the title screen. It should be a house or something indicative of it.
- **Scores**: This is to take the player to the scoreboard. It should be a podium or trophy.
